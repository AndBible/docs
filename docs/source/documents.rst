`Books`_, and `Maps`_. You can `Download Documents`_, :doc:`backup_restore`
documents, and `Load Documents`_ from your device's filesystem.

Document Library

The `Document Library` contains the list of all Bibles, commentaries, dictionaries,
books, and other modules that have been download.
The `Document Library` can be accessed in a few different ways:

  - Click and hold on the document name on the top of the menu bar.
  - Click the top left |hamburger| icon and click `Choose Document`.

Bibles
------

Bibles modules can be installed in different languages, translations, and formats.
Many Bible modules contain Strong's numbers, footnotes, cross-references, and study notes.

Commentaries
------------

Commentaries contain explanations or interpretations of other Bibles or books.
Many commentaries will contain interactive Bible references, and can be
:doc:`navigated <navigation>` like Bible modules.

Dictionaries
------------

Dictionaries provide additional information about individual words. |app| supports
Greek and Hebrew Strong's dictionaries, Robinson's Greek morphology, and others.

Strong's and Robinson dictionaries can be used as the primary lookup for words
in Strong's enabled document modules (like KJV, BSB, NASB, NET, etc):

#. From the main menu (|hamburger|) click `Application preferences`
#. Click on `Strong's Greek Dictionary` to select the Strong's Greek dictionary you want to use.
#. Click on `Strong's Hebrew Dictionary` to select the Strong's Hebrew dictionary you want to use.
#. Click on `Robinson Greek morphology` to select the Robinson Greek dictionary you want to use.
#. In the main menu toolbar, click the Greek/Hebrew icon until dotted lines appear
   below the words.

To view the Strong's definition for a word, simply click on a word in a Strong's
enabled Bible module.

To display the Strong's numbers in the Bible instead of underlines,
click on the Greek or Hebrew icon on the top menu bar (For books in Hebrew,
this icon shows Hebrew letters and for books in Greek the icon shows a Greek letter).

Toggling this icon can show underlines, Strong's numbers, or no links at all.

It is also possible to display the dictionary definitions in a special window
rather than a pop-up dialog:

  - From the main menu (|hamburger|) click on `Application preferences` and
    enable the `Links window` option.
