Workspaces
==========

The way we use our Bibles differs depending on what where doing. 

* For personal devotions we might like just one Bible in large print with no bookmarks. 
* For daily readings we may prefer several Bibles in different translations. 
* At church we could show one Bible and a sermon notes Study Pad. 
* And for focused Bible study we might have many Bibles-and-commentaries ready for easy access. 

Workspaces help you do all this and more. 

Workspaces remember:

* the current bible references
* the window arrangement
* colors 
* fonts
* and most other window settings

Access the list of workspaces via the 'dot' menu or by swiping down on the verse selector. This list allows you to:

* reorder workspaces
* create new workspaces
* and delete existing ones

The Settings option allows you to edit the default settings for all windows in the workspace. 

The gray workspace icon indicates you are changing a workspace default setting. These settings affect all windows in the workspace that are using the defaults.

A green workspace icon indicates that this window setting *is* using the default workspace setting.

If there is no green-workspace-icon, then the setting has been changed manually and the workspace settings won't affect it. Restore it to the default by pushing the Reset button.
