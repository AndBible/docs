Study Pads
==========

* A study pad allows you to view all your notes on a particular topic. 
* In the Bible Study App, a topic is simply a ‘label’. 
* Notes can be added to a study pad directly or by adding a note to a bookmarked verse with that label.
* A label could be anything – a topic like 'Holiness' , 'Salvation' or an event like 'Sermon on 24 February'.
* Once we have a label we can view the study-pad associated with it.
* Of course, because we don't yet have any bookmarks with this label and we haven't added any notes, the study pad is empty.
* Let's give the study-pad a better title. To do this we need to add a note. Click  the plus button.
* Now let's add our first Bible reference. In a bible window, :ref:`add a bookmark <Creating a bookmark>` and assign it the study pad label.
* You can see as soon as we add this label to a verse, it appears in the study pad.
* Now, suppose we want to add a note that is directly related to the verse we just bookmarked. 
  To do that we need to go to the bookmark itself and add the note. The new note automatically appears.
* Now let's try bookmarking a few words.
* You can see that each new bookmark with this label is automatically added to the Study Pad.
* Suppose now that the speaker is no longer talking about a specific verse. That means we want to add a general note to the study pad, not to the verse itself. We push the Plus button again and enter a note.
* We can tell that a note is not attached to a verse if we try to move it. Click the dot menu and then click and hold the arrow button.
* Now lets try that with the verse. See how the note moves with-the-verse.
* The dot menu provides some additional features. You can collapse the verse so it takes up less space by pushing the Collapse button.
* You can also indent a section.
* Or you can remove it completely. But be careful! That will delete the bookmark and any note attached to it.
* Finally, it would be great if there was an easy way to label a verse. You can do that by setting the 'auto-assign' property of a label.
* You can also set that property directly from the list.
* Now when you add a new bookmark it will automatically get that label - and it will automatically appear in your Study Pad.
* Taking sermon notes has never been easier!
* So, in summary, every label has its own study pad. When you add a label to a verse, the verse will automatically appear in the Study Pad. And finally, any notes added to the bookmark will also appear in the Study Pad.
