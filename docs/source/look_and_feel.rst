Look and Feel
=============

You can use the workspace "All Text Options" to change the look and feel of document texts.
You can access these options from the kabab menu on the top right (aka three vertical dots).
Use this menu to adjust various |app| appearance options including font size and type, text
and background colors, toggling words of Christ in red, and more.

When using multiple windows, you can use the individual window text options to override
current workspace settings. Tap and hold the square window icon at the bottom for the
window whose settings you wish to customize.  Choose "Text Options" then "All Text Options".
This will open the menu to configure |app|'s' appearance for that specific window.

For things that can not be changed through these menus, like the color of certain
texts within a module, e.g. Strong's numbers, you can code the color in the style.css
file located within  a zip package. You can use HiSB Bible module to see the structure
and placement of this file, it should be located in the modules/texts/ztext/hisb/style
directory.
Once coded, you simply use the "Load From Zip" function under the Backup/Restore section
of the main menu.
