Voice used for speaking
-----------------------
|app| uses the `Text to Speech <https://www.lifewire.com/use-google-text-to-speech-on-android-4767200>`_ functionality of your device 
to speak the text of the Bible, commentaries and books. The quality and listenability of these voices varies greatly and is not something we control. 
Most devices allow you to choose a different voice and modify pitch and speed. You can also install 3rd party Text-to-Speech engines which may
be superior to the default ones available.

How to change the voice differs between devices. Try searching in Settings for ``Text-to-Speech > Preferred engine > Install voice data``.

The `Speak` dialog can be accessed from:
