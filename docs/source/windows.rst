The 'Bible Study App' provides amazing window functionality. 

* Open as many windows as you need, showing 'any' document you want. 
* Show your 'preferred' bible, a translation with 'Strongs' numbers or 'another' language translation. You can also show cross-references, commentaries and dictionaries. You can 'even' show maps.  
* Each window has its 'own' button at the bottom of the screen. Use it to show or hide 'that' window. Or long press the button to access the 'popup menu'.  
* You can also access the popup menu from the button at the 'top right' of each window. The appearance of each window can be configured from the 'Text Options' menu.  
* Windows can be synced so they 'always' show the same verse by setting the 'Synchronise' option. There are three types of windows. Pinned windows, Unpinned windows and the 'Link' window.  
* Any number of pinned windows can be shown at one time. Only one unpinned window can be shown at once.  
* Document links are always opened in the links window.  Change a window type by changing the Pin setting.

Creating and configuring windows
--------------------------------
Multiple windows makes it easy to compare and drill down into verses. 

There are three ways to create a new window.  

1. First, push the New Window button in the bottom right corner. 
2. Second, choose 'New Window' via the window button at the top right of any window. 
3. Third, long-press a window button at the bottom of the screen and choose 'New Window'. 

There are multiple ways to choose the document you want to show in the new window. 

1. You can choose a Bible by clicking the Bible-button at the top. 
2. Or you can choose a commentary by clicking the Commentary-button. 
3. Or you can choose any document from the application menu. 

A window can be maximised so it takes up the whole screen. Restore it to its original size by pushing the restore-window button in the bottom right of the screen. 

A window can be minimised so that is hidden from view.  Show the window again by clicking it's button in the window-button-bar at the bottom of the screen. 
Reposition the window by using the 'Move To' menu option. 

A window has many customisation settings. The most recently used settings appear in the pop-up menu. But you can access all window settings via the 'All-text-options' menu item. 

It's important to understand the difference between workspace-settings and window-settings. These settings are nearly the same so it's easy to get them confused. 

* Workspace-settings are accessed via the dot menu at the top right of the screen. 
* Workspace-settings have the gray-workspace-icon. 
* Workspace-settings apply to ALL windows. 

Now for Window settings. They are accessed via the window-buttons. 

* Window-settings have either a green-workspace-icon or no icon at all. 
* Window-settings will use the workspace-setting unless you have changed it to something different. 

So, if you want to change the appearance of all windows, change the workspace-setting. But if you only want one window to look different, change the window-setting. 

Some examples:

* I want the cross-reference window only to have a different background color. So I change the window-setting. 
* I want all other windows to have a different background color. So I change the workspace-setting. This won't affect the window I just changed because setting the color at the Window-level overrides the workspace-setting. 
* And finally I want all windows to have a smaller font-size. So I change the font-size workspace-setting.
