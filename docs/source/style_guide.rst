Find words that are a within a specific distance. To do a proximity search use the tilde, "~", symbol at the end of a phrase. 
For example to search for a "God" and "light" within 10 words of each other in a document use the search:


    "God light"~3

.. note::
    The order of the words are important. The above example will find verses where the word 'God' comes before the word 'light'
