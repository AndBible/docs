Overview
--------
Labels are a way to tag a piece of information in |app|. Labels can be assigned
to bookmarks, study pads, and personal notes.

Open Label settings
-------------------
To manage and see a list of all of your labels:

1. Click the vertical 'three-dot' menu on the top right of the main toolbar.
2. Click `Label settings...`.

Alternatively, when creating a bookmark, you can assign and manage labels by
clicking on the `Select or edit labels...` button on the bottom of the
`Bookmark Labels` dialog.

Searching for a Label
---------------------
If many labels exist, it may be helpful to search for specific labels:

1. `Open Label settings`_
2. Begin typing the name (or part of the name) of the label you want to find.
   (The results will automatically filter as you type)


Create a label
--------------
To create a label:

1. `Open Label settings`_
2. Click the `Plus` (+) button at the top
3. Enter a label name.
4. Optionally, `Change Label Settings`_


Delete a label
--------------
To delete a label:

1. `Open Label settings`_
2. Click the label you would like to delete.
3. Click the Trash icon in the top right.
4. Click `Yes` to confirm deletion. (This will remove the label from all
   bookmarks, notes, and associated Study Pad.)


Change Label Settings
---------------------

Various label settings exist to apply different styling to and make assigning the
label easier. You can:

   * Change the color of a label by clicking the label icon next to the label name.
   * Favorite a label to make it easier to select when assigning bookmark labels.
   * Assign a custom marker icon to a label.
     (The custom icon will be used as the bookmark icon if the label is the
     primary label on the bookmark)
   * Have either an underline or background coloring style.
   * Hide the label from applying any kind of styling (or visible icon) to the bookmark.
   * 'Auto-assign' labels to new bookmarks. (This applies to the active workspace)
   * Set the label as the 'main label' for new bookmarks.
     (The `main label` is the label that is listed first and determines the style
     of the bookmark)
