Go to a Bible reference
-------------------------
Tap the Bible reference at the top:

The "Book Chooser" will display where you can select any book that is available in the current document.
For example, in regular Bible documents you'll be able to see all 66 books of the Bible, but if you
go to the Book Chooser when the active window is a smaller commentary, it will only show the books that
are available in that commentary.

After you select the book, it will take you to the next screen where you can select the chapter.

After selecting chapter it will take you back to the Bible screen and open the Bible at that reference.

Opening Deuterocanonical books
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When your active window is a Bible version that contains deuterocanonical books, there will be a '+' icon
in the "Book Chooser" where you are then able to see the rest of the deuterocanonical books. For example,
open KJVA in a window, go to the "Book Chooser" and you should see a '+' menu icon close to the top right.
Tap that and it will display the deuterocanonical books in the list.


Navigate directly to verse number
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you would like to have another screen to select the verse number, you can enable that in Application preferences.
1. Go to the main menu on left side, then click "Application preferences"
2. Find and enable the setting called "Navigate to verse"

Now after selecting the chapter number it will bring you to the next screen with verse numbers where you can select
the exact verse you want to navigate to.
