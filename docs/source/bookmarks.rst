Bookmarks
=========

Overview
--------

A bookmark is a label attached to a verse. A bookmark can be added to whole verses.
When added to whole verses, the bookmark is visible in all translations.
A bookmark can also be added to part of a verse.
When added to part of a verse, only an icon is visible in other translations.
Multiple labels can be added to a single bookmark. Multiple bookmarks can be added to the same verse.
The verse action dialog shows all bookmarks for that verse, not just the bookmark clicked on.
