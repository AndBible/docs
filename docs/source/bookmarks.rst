Bookmarks
=========

Overview
--------

A bookmark is a `label <https://andbible.readthedocs.io/en/stable/labels.html>`_
attached to a selection of text, a verse, or a range of verses.

When a bookmark is added to an entire verse (or range of verses), the bookmark will
be visible in all other translations. Bookmarks applied to only a selection of text
will, however, only be visible as an icon in other translations.

Multiple `labels <https://andbible.readthedocs.io/en/stable/labels.html>`_ can
be added to a single bookmark and multiple bookmarks can be added to a single
verse. The verse action dialog shows all bookmarks for that verse, not only the
selected bookmark.

Creating a bookmark
-------------------
To create a bookmark:

1. Click on the verse you want to bookmark.
2. In the verse action dialog, Click the `Bookmark` button.
3. Optionally, add `labels <https://andbible.readthedocs.io/en/stable/labels.html>`_
   to your bookmark.

To add a bookmark to part of a verse:

1. Click and hold on a word that you want to bookmark.
2. Extend the text selection as required.
3. Choose `Selection` or `Bookmark > Selection` (the options displayed are
   controlled by the 'One-step bookmarking' application preference).
   Choosing `Verses` bookmarks the whole verse.
4. Optionally, add `labels <https://andbible.readthedocs.io/en/stable/labels.html>`_
   to the bookmark.

To add a bookmark to multiple verses:

1. Click the first verse you want to bookmark.
2. Click the `Plus` (+) button in the upper right of the verse action dialog.
   The following verse is automatically selected.
3. Click on a later verse to extend the verse range.  To shorten the range,
   Click any verse in the existing range and the range will end at that verse.
4. Click the `Bookmark` button and optionally select a
   `label <https://andbible.readthedocs.io/en/stable/labels.html>`_.
